I'm a scholarship holder here at, KMC - Lalitpur. My hometown is dhangadhi and currently I'm residing at Balkumari, Lalitpur. In my perspective, the most crucial period for a student is their lower classes (class 1- 8).. the students in their higher studies lags behind because of their weak knowledge base in their lower classes. Lack of visualization in learning and a correct way of studying during school might be its reasons. As a higher secondary level student i gained and understand the importance of base knowledge and i knew what smart study looks like. So, not only the course matters...but also, my efforts will include a visualization of theory ,a proper way of studying , deliver a lifelong and practical concepts that would be advantageous for him/her in higher studies, and to give a clear view of course content with it depth knowledge so that he / she could compete in further competitive exams too. In short , i will try to change the way of studying , make it more fun with a long term vision so that it would be fruitful for their further higher classes too..to whom i will be tutoring ..

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Thapathali Campus.
From my childhood, I have always been keen to teaching. My keenness for it was not only bounded in academics, rather, I used to teach my friends, siblings about everything that I had grasp upon. Even in academics, my friends used to come to my home to understand topics they were confused in. And, luckily, they were quite satisfied with my teaching. This habit of teaching not only helped others, but also gave me better understanding of the topics I used to teach. This same keenness for teaching and my own curiosity for STEM gave me the confidence and knowledge to crack and get admission into one of the top Engineering College of Nepal.
As a person, I am a perfectionist. I am very persistent and disciplined towards my job. I put extra efforts on anything I do and try to do it at my best.
Previously, I have been tutoring for 1 year. As a tutor, I try to dissect the topic my student is confused in as much as possible. I bring curiosity and enthusiasm to my student while teaching any topic. I heavily give emphasis on understanding than just mugging up. As per my pervious students, they were quite satisfied with my teaching."

I make sure that my class remains as interactive as possible, thereby preventing students getting bored of me. Likewise, I introduce practical examples that students encounter in their everyday lives when teaching intricate concepts. I make sure that I empathize with students, understand their confusions, reluctance to approaching difficult concepts, ultimately leading them to completely understand such concepts, while making the class fun, interesting, and interactive. I have helped many students come out of their confusions because of which they no longer become scared of difficult subjects like mathematics and science.
As I was a struggling students myself in my school days, I can truly understand what students feel like when they don't understand what they learn at school. Likewise, this feeling becomes even more intimidating when their classmates excel at their students while they remain clueless. Thus, I can assure that needy students will definitely benefit a lot if they learn with me. Lastly, I find teaching a fun and interesting activity. I believe these are the reasons that make me a great teacher."

I believe “One of the most difficult aspects of becoming a teacher is learning how to motivate your students. Students who are not motivated will not learn effectively. They won’t retain information, they won’t participate and some of them may even become disruptive. A student may be unmotivated for a variety of reasons: They may feel that they have no interest in the subject, find the teacher’s methods un-engaging or be distracted by external forces. It may even come to light that a student who appeared unmotivated actually has difficulty learning and is need of special attention” ."

I have seen a lot of teachers who just teach to make their living, who are completely unpassionate about their jobs, remains only on the boundary of the course book, make you solve problems without telling where the heck will it help in your life. Trust me, I have also been through these kind of teachers throughout my life, and this is why most students really don't care about their academics.
I am here to make you realize how and why Science, Maths, and Computer are truly essential for you. I will make you question each and everything around you, and teach you how to think rationally to approach those questions.
I will make you comfortable enough to ask the stupidest question that you will ever think of, who knows maybe the stupidest looking question be the next revolution for human mankind.
So, get ready to wonder.
My experience::
I have been a self employed part time home tutor since I was in grade 9. My job is to teach students, Maths and Science (Qualitative and Quantitative), basically the broad picture of Maths and Science and how to use them in our daily basis .

While I may have graduated in a technical field, my love for giving back to the society, and my skills in parting knowledge to friends and students has brought me to the field of teaching and tutoring.
Since, I myself prefer understanding concepts over memorizing them, I prefer to help my students understand and where needed remember/memorize using techniques such as mnemonics, visualization and mind-mapping. Mnemonics can be used to remember points using short forms and sentence forming from the first letter of every word. Visualization is used to draw a diagram that incudes whatever is needed to be remembered. Finally, mind mapping helps to divide the information into chunks of branches that is easier to remember. I believe that the era of memorizing facts and figures have gone with the technological advancements and so teaching must also evolve with this.
Students are children with curiosity in mind and the old education system may have made education bland and hectic. I wish to bring back the spark of curiosity in children and help them grow their minds.
Lastly, I also add extra-curriculars to teaching, as I believe textbook knowledge is simply not enough to grow the personality of the student. Communication skills, creativity and mental health is equally important. So I try to indulge my students in such activities at least once or twice a month, giving them more time to integrate that into their studies."

Respected Sir/Madam,
I am Hari Sharan Pandit, Secondary Level Mathematics Teacher at Budhanilkantha School, Kathmandu, Nepal.
I have been teaching Mathematics of grades 7-12 since 2008 and Cambridge Assessment AS and A Levels Pure Mathematics (9709) including Further Mathematics since 2015.
I have recently participated in a 2 - day training on Metacognition - An Effective Classroom Talk at The British School, New Delhi on 14-15 January, 2020; organized by Cambridge Assessment International Examinations. Also, on 21-22 September, 2011, I had participated in the Stage – I training for Mathematics Teachers of AS and A Level Mathematics and Statistics.
Besides regular teaching, I have been actively participating in developing creative teaching materials, games and puzzles to enrich and enhance my own teaching and to help other teachers. I have been supporting a number of A Level Mathematics teachers of Nepal and abroad; specially on developing teaching materials.
Due to COVID – 19 pandemic, our school has started online classes from 15th April, 2020 for all of our students. I have been teaching Pure and Further Mathematics online via Microsoft Teams. It has been a quite fantastic experience for me.
On 22nd April, I had organized a national level webinar on How to Incorporate Critical Thinking Skills in teaching and learning of Mathematics with Prof. Dr. Bal Chandra Luitel (Dean, Kathmandu University, School of Education) as the Guest Speaker. It was an excellent webinar it have conducted so far.
Our school (Budhanilkantha School: Website: bnks.edu.np) is the top ranked school supported by government -run under public trust category. We have been running grades 5-12 under NEB (National Educational Board ), Nepal and CAIE AS and A Level classes. We have some 1160 students from all 77 districts of Nepal representing all castes, ethnicity, geographic regions and religions.
I have very much interested to work as an Online Tutor of Mathematics (Pure/Further) as a part-time tutor. Based on my recent work experiences of conducting online classes and most importantly; my knowledge, skills and ability to teach AS/A Level Mathematics, I believe that I can confidently teach Pure/Further Mathematics as per your standard.
If I am offered this opportunity, I would be much more delighted to work as an Online Tutor as per the demand with true spirit and great enthusiasm.
I look forward to receive your kind response.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
Hari Sharan Pandit"

I am Manish and I am writing this to describe how I share my knowledge with students. I like a friendly environment with students. My past records suggest that the students are very happy with what I teach, and their significant improvement in grades suggests I am on the right track. My presentation skills help me and my students stay focused on the topic that I teach, and the edification process gets easier. Since I become close to students, they feel less anxious about asking questions. I try to incorporate all students while teaching, regardless of their intelligence, which helps all of my students significantly comprehend the matter that I teach. I am sometimes strict, which means the students know that they should adhere to the discipline and maintain a good culture in the classroom. This teaching methodology always allows students to concentrate on their studies without feeling rushed. They realize that education is fun when there is a good teacher around.
Regards,
Manish Dangi

That's clearly a right path to make a right choices. Sometimes, you might fail in one, but opens doors in many.Just believe in yourself, you will learn the art of succeeding even through failures.
P.S. I currently reside in Satungal, Kathmandu. I have been teaching two classes nearby my areas. So, I can afford to teach in Kalanki To Thankot Area(more easily than others). Just grab up my number and please feel free to call. You are welcome :) :)"

I have been great help to them because of our less age gap. I usually focus on a student's weak portion of studies and give them regular practise to help them memorize easily. The tasks I allocate to student's is moderate and only necessary amount, so that students will not be stressed as they have daily school works to attend too. As a student myself, I know about stress and I always try not to put more pressure on students. Learning and gaining knowledge is not possible in high pressure. One year of experience maybe small amount of time but I have faced different types of students. My methodology is to find out what's making a subject difficult for student and eliminating them. The students I have taught had all passed the exams which they failed before. So, I hope my methods of teaching were proven effective. I start by analysing the student's past exam reports and finding out weak points of them and eradicating those mistakes."

Teaching is sort of my hobby, although I don't have much of commercial teaching background, I have been guiding my own brother and sister for several years. From that relative experience, I am pretty sure a student can always be self reliant and should be motivated to pursue their studies on their own basis and effort on first hand, and then only given guidance for any further problems. I hope I can provide necessary guidance on their expertise and also inspire them for self study. I am capable of teaching some subjects from Grade 8 to Grade 12."

Smriti Rai,"Female, 20 years",9808079884,smriti.kulung655@gmail.com,Bachelors Degree (Pursuing),2 Years,Kathmandu,Student's home or My own place,"I was a competitive student, thanks to my older brother. Being just 2 years of age gap, we were in constant competition of who gets the highest marks and impresses our parents.
Later I realized, studying should not be done just to impress the parents, but to have a clear goal in mind and a good discipline. Because ""Discipline is consistent, but motivation fades away fast.""
So, if I have a chance to give an advise to my juniors, I'd say, Don't wait for motivation to come and hit you. Motivation will make you feel passionate and powerful, enlightens a fire within you, but it'll fade away soon. Discipline is what keeps you going in life. It doesn't just apply to your studies, but your overall life.
Even if you're bad at studying, don't give up!
I was a C grade student when I joined a boarding school from government one. But I soon caught up. Even more, I surpassed the majority.
Top 45 ranking to top 5 ranking, can't be more proud of my child-self.
If I can do it, you can do it too!"

Using proper regulatory standards at school, state, and federal levels has permitted me to assist students with their development in skills like time management and presentation of information through recorded lessons posted on YouTube. In addition to these specific areas of expertise, I have utilized my skills with online learning platforms to create lessons, post assignments, and communicate with students throughout the year.
